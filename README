The goal of the BioScala project is to create a scalable and functional
bioinformatics library; which can be used from Scala, Java, JRuby,
Jython and Clojure; building on existing libraries available on the JAVA
Virtual Machine (JVM), including BioJAVA and BioRuby.

This is the place for the BioScala project under the liberal BSD license.

This edition of BioScala has:

  - Strongly typed DNA, RNA Sequence, gapped and IUPAC ambiguous Sequence
  - Sequences contain lists of Nucleotide, AminoAcid, IUPAC, Gapped, Codon
  - Flexible Sequence user defined attributes
  - Transcription of DNA to RNA
  - Translation of (ambiguous) RNA to AA (using BioJava3)
  - Formats:
	  . Iterator based FASTA reader and writer
    . Iterator based PAML (PHY) file format reader
    . Phylip reader/writer (using BioJava)
  - Alignments and attributes (work in progress)
  - A translation example of calling into BioRuby
  - A tutorial in ./doc/tutorial.txt

BioScala uses the simple build tool (sbt) and behaviour driven development/unit
testing. See the INSTALL file for more information.
